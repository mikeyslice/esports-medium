  title: How can I trust this Skillz powered mobile game?
  answer: I’m not surprised this made it to number one on the FAQ. I was skeptical at first too. I won over $200 before I made my first deposit. After I got the checks in the mail, I was confident Skillz was legit. You can take it from me or make a withdraw with the winnings from your bonus cash you receive from winning 25 practice matches on any Skillz game.

  title: How can I cash out my available balance? I did the deposit and I’m winning but it’s never going to my withdrawable amount. What’s the point of winning if it’s just bonus cash to play more games and win more bonus cash?
  answer: Whenever you win you get your entry fee back plus whatever you won in real withdrawable cash. If you play for $350 entry to win $600 and all your entry fee is bonus cash, your withdrawable balance is $250. If you go to play another game, it’ll use 90% real cash and 10% bonus cash. It’s nearly impossible to fully convert 100% bonus cash accounts into real cash. Once you’ve converted your balance into real cash go to the menu > Personal Account & Withdraw > Withdraw > Enter desired withdraw amount. Note - You’ll lose any bonus cash you have left in your account once you withdraw.
