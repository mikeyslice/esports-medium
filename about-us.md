## About Mikey Slice

I love what I do. Such as educate, entertain, and inspire those who are trying to make a career out of gaming. I do so by creating content that shows the steps I take toward a gaming career. Therefore this website is a result of just that. Skillz has made the ability to make a career out of gaming so much easier!

I have been playing on the Skillz multiplayer platform since January of 2015. I’ve made about $25,000 since then. It’s been a great experience and I can’t wait to see where my future goes with this company. I’m technically a pro gamer at this point. Which is pretty awesome!
