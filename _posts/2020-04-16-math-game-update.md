## Mikey's Mini Math Game v2 Change Log

In this version:

```
- increased timer from 200ms to 300ms
- added the code stash feature 
- fail results are now displayed on the next screen for transparency
- codes will now auto refresh each day (5/day)
- codes are valid for 7 days
- each round the code drop level is reset [4, 5, 6+]
- each round the stash drop score is reset [100 - 150]
```

## Skillz Match Codes

Each day Mikey will activate 5 new event codes, one per game.

It's easy to find which game the code is for by looking for the [BST, CC, DG, SC, SEB] letters or the ending number:


- **Bubble Shooter Tournaments** `MIKEYSLICEBST*****01`

- **Cube Cube** `MIKEYSLICECC*****02`

- **Dominoes Gold** `MIKEYSLICEDG*****03`

- **Solitaire Cube** `MIKEYSLICESC*****04`

- **Strike! eSports Bowling** `MIKEYSLICESEB*****05`


## Game Drops

The game will drop each code at random levels:

* **Level 4 & 5**: 33% drop chance

* **Level 6+**: 100% drop chance

Reach **Level 6** to get a guaranteed drop.

*Note that since the drop is random, codes can repeat.*



## The Stash

If you reach **Level 10** you *could* get the ultimate drop in one single run: **all 5 codes for the day**!

This can drop within this **Score** range: 100 - 150 Points, so keep going as far as you can to increase your chances.


## Codes Expiry

Codes have a validity of 7 days, so they will expire in 1 week.
