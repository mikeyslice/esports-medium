## Story

I want to build a mobile app for you to get my live streams, 24/7 live chat, match codes, promo codes, Skillz strategies, and downloads to Skillz games all in one place! You'll also receive push notifications when I go live with new match codes.

Right now you have to watch my live streams on YouTube, get the match codes from eSportsMedium.com, then download the games from a different page on eSportsMedium.com. You're going back and forth from app to app. That's all going to change with this mobile app! We're taking the live stream from YouTube and adding it to MikeySlice.com in the next week or 2. That new live stream will include a 24/7 live chat feature as well. Similar to the one on Cube Cube.

You can help me build this by pledging on the official [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikeyslice/mikeyslice-hybrid-mobile-app?ref=aqp0a2)!

### Deadline

Since it's an *All or nothing* kickstarter, this project will __only__ be funded if it reaches its goal by Tue, May 5 2020 1:55 PM UTC +00:00.

Every little bit helps, even $1!
