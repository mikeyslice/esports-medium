## What is a Skillz game?{::options auto_ids="false" /}

What is Skillz Inc.? You may have heard of them from a friend, or if you’re like me you don’t have friends. 

So, you found them on a Facebook ad promising that you can win money playing mobile Skillz games. 

But, when you looked them up on Google to see if they’re legit, the only information you could find is from their website, Skillz.com. I had the same problem when I first started. Lucky for you though, you have this blog post. 

I did some digging around, and I found some articles from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2017/12/13/mobile-esports-leader-raises-25-million-series-c-round-and-aspires-to-go-public/#54c91b66136a), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/09/skillz-hands-out-prize-money-to-gamers-what-that-means-for-esports.html), and [PocketGamer.biz](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/interview/69056/how-real-money-competition-platform-skillz-is-riding-the-wave-of-mobile-esports-for-all/) that will help us better understand [Skillz](https://skillz.com/). 

Skillz is a company that allows game developers to turn any mobile game into an eSport. Players match based on skill. 

High skilled vs high skilled, low skilled vs low skilled. This is fair.

## Skillz is a Company{::options auto_ids="false" /}

What I found is that Skillz is a company that allows game developers to use the Skillz platform to turn any mobile game into an eSport. Players match one another based on their skills in that game. The higher skilled players will play against other highly skilled players, and the new players will play against the other new players. This gives everyone a fair chance to win each and every game they play.

## Skillz Runs eSports Tournaments{::options auto_ids="false" /}

On a daily basis Skillz runs about 2 million tournaments each day! Some of those tournaments offer real cash prizes. And all of their games are free to install on your mobile device. So, what are you waiting for? You can win money playing their free mobile games right now! We've compiled a list of their [most popular games](/skillz-games/).

Still not convinced? Let me know in the comments below what’s holding you back, so I can make videos in the future to help others just like you find the information they need to feel more comfortable. Because this is a huge opportunity for any gamer, and I don’t want anyone missing out!

## Skillz Has A Lot Of Players{::options auto_ids="false" /}

Skillz currently has 18 million registered users on their platform. 18 MILLION! Therefore, Skillz has hosted over 800 million tournaments since 2012. That’s almost a billion! 

Skillz looks too good to be true though. Doesn’t it? That’s what I thought when I downloaded their game in 2015 after seeing an ad on Facebook of a guy holding a check from Skillz for $20,000 on top of his Jet Ski that he also won from Skillz. Yeah right, where’s the catch?

## Where’s The Catch?{::options auto_ids="false" /}

At first glance it looks like there isn’t one. Look a little bit closer, and you’ll see something very shocking. 

That is that in order to play their games for cash you’ll need to allow the game to use your location while you play. This both invades your privacy and eats your battery life. But, is it worth it? Let’s see.

So basically Skillz is a company that created a platform that goes into a mobile game. That mobile game will allow you to play against other players for money. 

You can choose to play against those players in a variety of different ways. However, each way has different entry fees. You can play for  FREE all the way up to as much as $350. The winner of the $350 match will get $600. 

So Skillz takes about 17% from that game for hosting that match. However, if you play for 60 cents the winner gets a dollar. So they take 20% there. So that means you would have to win 70% of your games just to break even right?

## Gambling?{::options auto_ids="false" /}

Lucky for us, Skillz gives us more than just the cash games to turn a profit. I’m a losing player. Which mean I lose more than 50% of my games, yet I’ve pulled a profit year after year for the past 4 years. But wait! Isn’t that gambling? No, actually. It’s not. Here’s why. 

You see, online casinos are not legal in the majority of the states in the US, because luck determines the outcome more than skill does. Skillz on the other hand is not like the casino. 

Since the winner of each match is dependent on how well you scored during that specific match. The player that scored higher will win the money. Both players will be given the same exact setup in the game, with the same time to complete the game. The player that finishes the game with a higher score wins.

## How to Become Skillz Enabled{::options auto_ids="false" /}

In order for a game to even get approved by Skillz to be on the Skillz platform that game will have to pass a test. That test will make sure that luck isn’t a huge factor in that mobile game. 

They do this by taking a skilled player and a new player, if the game is won by the skilled player more than 70% of the time it’s approved. If the skilled player wins less than 70% of the time, Skillz won’t approve that game to be on their platform since luck determines the outcome more than skill does. Because of this, Skillz is legal in the majority of states in the US, while the same cannot be said about online gambling sites.

## Excluded States{::options auto_ids="false" /}

The only states that won’t allow you to play these Skillz games for money are Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee. However, some Skillz games have playing cards involved like their most popular game, Solitaire Cube. Any game using playing cards, like Solitaire Cube, cannot be played for money in Maine or Indiana. 

If you live in any of the states that I just mentioned you may want to consider moving, because Skillz games are just now starting to get big, and you’re going to miss out if you live in any state that won’t allow you to play Skillz games for cash. It is worth noting that you can still download and play these games, you just won’t be able to play for cash. If you do play for cash you’ll be matched against players of equal skill.

## Player Matching{::options auto_ids="false" /}

Their player matching is almost too good!

They match you with players that are so close to your skill level that you’re practically trading games.

Leaving Skillz as the only winner after 100 games.

Since they take 20% of each entry fee, if you lose 50% of your games you’ll end up losing money in the end.

However, this is just the tip of the iceberg on how to make money on Skillz games.


 
Believe it or not I lose more than 50% of my games and still pull a profit.

You can too if you play for high enough stakes, and take advantage of other money making features on their apps.

More on this in a future video.

Skillz also has anti-cheating mechanisms to ensure that all players are playing fairly.

Their anti-cheating mechanisms are basically red flags from what I understand.

If a player aborts too many games they will get a red flag on their account and Skillz will look more into it.

Since you’re matched based on skill, if you submit a score of 0 that will lower your average score, and match you against lower skilled players.

Because of this, it’s cheating to intentionally abort games to lower your average score.

Thus resulting in a red flag.

If someone is scoring higher than their typical skill level they will also receive a red flag.

Skillz will follow up to these red flags by asking that player to play a game while on a Skype call to make sure they’re actually playing and not using a cheating software.

 
If they fail to perform during this Skype call their account could be terminated, and the players who lost to them in the past will get a refund for the games that they lost.
