title: Math Game Discontinued

---


## Shifting focus

We've decided to shift focus and energy on **eSportsMedium Live** for the foreseeable future.

Thus, the MMM game will no longer be operational. The time and energy it took to generate codes, create pdf's and keep everything updated will be reallocated to streaming and upgrades.


## Skillz Match Codes

From now on you will be get all the event codes by watching Mikey's live streams and videos.


## Thank you

Love it or hate it, thank you for playing the math game! That's over now, but we're moving on to bigger things!

Keep an eye on this blog for quick updates on our progress.
