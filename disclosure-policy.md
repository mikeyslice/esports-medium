## Endorsements

eSports Medium is required by law from the FTC (Federal Trade Commision) to inform you of our intentions of our blog. We are not paid at all by any outside source to review their products or services at this time.

Skillz Inc. pays me, Michael Kimble, when I’ve converted the bonus cash into real cash successfully through playing their games. I receive $10 bonus cash when someone uses my promo code on their first deposit. Other than that I do not make any money from Skillz Inc. or its’ affiliates to write content on my website. The content on this website is intended to benefit me, and my visitors, by earning bonus cash from first time depositors on the Skillz Inc. multiplayer platform. Both the user and I receive $10 bonus cash when that user makes their first deposit.

I am a Skillz Inc. affiliate. I earn $2 per install and 40% on every deposit that player makes for the first 90 days their account is open. I will also make money from Google AdSense eventually when this blog becomes more popular.
