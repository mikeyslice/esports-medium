## Contents

After purchase you will receive an email containing a PDF file with __at least 35 active Skillz Match Codes__. These are valid for April 26th - May 16th, 2020.

Just open the file and use the codes for the appropriate games, before they expire.

Each week Mikey will generate new event codes for you and add them to the shop.

## Games

Each code is to be used with a specific Skillz game.

You can find which is which by looking for these characters inside each code:

-- `**BST**` stands for **Bubble Shooter Tournaments**

-- `*CC**` should be used with **Cube Cube**

-- `**DG**` is **Dominoes Gold**

-- `**SC**` is for **Solitaire Cube**

-- `**SEB**` is Strike **Esports Bowling**

You can download each game from the [Skillz Games](/skillz-games/) page.

## Validity

Each code is valid for 7 days from the date it has been activated, which is listed in the PDF.

Even if you purchase this pack on the last day (May 9th), you will still be guaranteed at least __35 active codes__!
