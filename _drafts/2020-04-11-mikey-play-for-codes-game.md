## Objective

Solve simple math as quickly as you can. Reach at least **Level 6** and the game is guaranteed to *drop* a random Skillz Match Code from the latest codes generated by Mikey. 

## Rules

You have ~~200ms (2 seconds)~~ 300ms (3 seconds) to act each turn.

The **Score** is just for vanity.

Since the drops are random, the same code can drop multiple times.

You can replay as much as you like, until you collect all the event codes or until you become a math genius!

## Vote on Games

Join Mikey on his [livestream](https://esportsmedium.com/YT-subscribe){:target="_blank"} to vote your preferred game.

You can find the Skillz games associated with each code on the [Skillz Match Codes](/skillz-match-codes) page.
